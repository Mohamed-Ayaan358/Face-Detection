## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The aim for this project is to detect the individual's face using a box shape image as well as other parts of the face.

Other aims include emotion detection and object identification in the case that there is no presence of a face.
This repository is written in python and uses the opencv library as it already has tools which can be used to record a live video as well as have a method to mark facial features with certain shapes.
We utilise HaarCascades so as to avoid having to write a seperate object detection algorithm, however their scope is limited due to limited number of haarCascades.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### 📃 Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Install OpenCV
- Install Python 3.7 (For best use as it is configured to OpenCV)
- Atleast one webcam(inbuilt/Added)

### 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Execute the Python script and note that you have specified your webcam in the script and are not using it for other purposes.
Be careful when downloading the correct haarCascades.
